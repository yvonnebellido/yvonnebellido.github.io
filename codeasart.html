<p>Throughout my 3D model, I decided to go for a natural environment with a odd twist. I wanted the prospective be from a camera and photographer in a uniqe world. Since, I love photography seeing the world through a camera is not odd. But, to anyone else is can be and they can explierence something new with this world. My model is very simple, but has a intresting effects with the background and foreground to play with. Like a camera, one can play with the focus and be captured into one image.</p>
