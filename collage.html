<p>For this project I had many ideas in mind and I didn't know if I could pull it off with my unfamiliarity in this medium. Even though I didn't know much, I wanted my collage to convey the feeling of stress and worry. The image of the defaced female with storm clouds represents the anxiety that comes when one's mental health is not doing that well. Behind the female's image is a mix of distorted photos of rain showing that one's perspective gets cloudy. Even with all the noise at the top of the collage, the bottom half is clean and simplistic. This represents how the outside world doesn't seem to see the distress inside our minds. I was influenced to create this work when experiencing low points with mental health. It's important to remember that the storms in our minds will pass in time and that self-care is needed.</p>
